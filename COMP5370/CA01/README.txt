Converts a file, plaintext.txt, into an encyrpted text using the Vigenere Tableau.
The first line of plaintext.txt should be the key, which will wrap around. 
The following lines of plaintext.txt should be the message to be encrypted. 
The output will be stored in result.txt. 

To run and compile, run bash runCA01.sh on a Unix based machine.
The script just compiles then runs the Java code.
