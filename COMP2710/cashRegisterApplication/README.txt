TO COMPILE:

First, move into the directory the C++ file is in.
Ex: cd Documents/cashRegisterApplication

Next, compile the program using gcc.
Ex: g++ skelton_4.cpp

This creates an output file of a.out.

TO RUN:
./a.out

TO END INPUT OF ITEMS:
Type “*”, a single asterisk, into the item field. Do not type a * at any other point in the program. 

Enjoy!
