TO COMPILE:

First, move into the directory the C++ file is in.
Ex: cd Documents/distributedTigerBook

Next, compile the program using gcc.
Ex: g++ distributedTigerBook.cpp

This creates an output file of a.out.

TO RUN:
./a.out

NOTE:
You must already have a timeStamp.txt file with a timeStamp contained in it. One is provided for you, or you can create your own. It should contain an integer value in the first position of the first line, and that is it. However, you do not have to provide your own tweet.txt, allUsers.txt, allPostsByFriends, or any user txt files.

The userName.txt file will be overwritten when the program is restarted.
The tweet.txt file will store all tweets from the beginning of time.
The timeStamp will not reset after the program is ended.
To reset the timeStamp or tweet.txt file, you can manually do that using a text editor.
If you add a multi-line tweet or post, it will be stored as one line, and therefore printed as one line. Please use correct punctuation marks in your posts and tweets.
